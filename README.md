# year3

This repo contains my typed notes for Year 3 of my degree.
The content of these notes is certainly not original work although some proofs and explanations may have been reworked in order to make more sense to me.
The presentation of the content (order and structure) is largely based on the respective courses at Warwick.
There are undoutably numerous errors.
